__AY2017/2018 Semester 2<br>
School of Computing<br>
National University of Singapore__

#### Taught by [Stephane Bressan](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~steph/) and [Chan Chee Yong](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chancy/)


## Description
The aim of this module is to introduce the fundamental concepts and techniques necessary for the understanding and practice of design and implementation of database applications and of the management of data with relational database management systems. The module covers practical and theoretical aspects of design with entity-relationship model, theory of functional dependencies and normalisation by decomposition in second, third and Boyce-Codd normal forms. The module covers practical and theoretical aspects of programming with SQL data definition and manipulation sublanguages, relational tuple calculus, relational domain calculus and relational algebra.

## Project

One of the important components of CS2102 is the team project. The objective of this team project is to apply what you have learned in class to design and develop a _web-based_ database application. The project is to be done in teams of **four** students.

### Project Topic: Pet Caring

This application allows pet owners to search for care takers for their pets for certain periods of time (e.g., https://dogvacay.com). Both users and pets have a profile. Care takers can advertise their availability (when they can take care of a pet, for how long, the kind of pet they can take care of and other constraints and requirements), and pet owners can browse/search for care takers and bid for their services. The successful bidder could either be chosen by the care taker or automatically selected by the system based on some criteria. Each user has an account, and administrators can create/modify/delete entries.

### Project Repository

- The project repository is currently hosted on GitHub. Please visit our project [Peter Finder](https://github.com/yunpengn/peterfinder).
- It makes use of PHP7, PostgreSQL 10, Bootstrap 4, jQuery Datatable plugin, Font Awesome 5, PHPMailer.
